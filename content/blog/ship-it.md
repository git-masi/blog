When I first started learning web development I could not wait to start shipping software.

Sure, it was cool to see something running locally but I wanted other people to be able to see my work on the open internet.

I remember my first website was hosted on namecheap. I had to use FTP to upload my HTML files and configuring the server was a chore. But I also remember the excitement of being able to go to https://ericmasi.com for the first time.

After that I deployed everything I could. Sometimes I would use namecheap. Other times I would use GitHub pages or Heroku. To this day my favorite project was creating a website that allowed you to guess how many palindromes exist in the English language and then it would let you scroll through and search the list afterwards. It sounds silly but I found a huge list of English words and determined all the palindromes programmatically. It was a fun challenge for a fledgling programmer even if the end result was somewhat unimpressive to the outside observer.

Learning about AWS and IaC kicked off the golden age of deployments for me. I would spin up AWS services on a whim and shut them down just as easily. Every little application, every thing I could think of got a CloudFormation template. I thought Serverless Framework was the coolest thing ever and I was the master of deploying software. In my own mind at least.

But over time I stopped deploying. As I advanced in my career the demands of my time and my mental energy increased. I wasn't churning out as many side projects or web pages. I even started to judge my past work. It wasn't cool it was lame. I could do much better now. But I didn't. And even my personal website, the one I struggled so hard to put up, was taken down.

This blog is the first thing that I have shipped outside of work in almost 2 years.

I want to get back to shipping more. I want to stop being so critical of my work and recapture the feeling of putting something out into the world for the fun of it.

My mantra for 2025 is "ship it."
